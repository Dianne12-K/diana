            <h2>Geomatics Engineering</h2>
            <p>Geomatics engineering is a field that focuses on spatial information. It involves the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data related to the earth's surface and its features.</p>
            <p>Key principles in geomatics include geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, surveying, cartography, and geodesy. Geomatics engineering plays a crucial role in various industries such as urban planning, environmental management, natural resource exploration, transportation, and disaster management.</p>
